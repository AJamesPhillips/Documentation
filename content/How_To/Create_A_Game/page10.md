# Summary
Now that we have our state machine set up, it's time to build a simple scene with a player and ground out of primitives! At this point, we only have an app.ts to deal with setting up scenes, so we're going to need to make some new files and classes.
1. environment.ts
2. characterController.ts

Feel free to make as many files as you need. I chose to work with only these files as I wanted to separate my code to focus on single aspects of the game.

# Environment
This [environment]() class will contain all information necessary for the game scene's world.
```javascript
export class Environment {
    private _scene: Scene;

    constructor(scene: Scene) {
        this._scene = scene;
    }

    public async load() {
        var ground = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateBox("ground", 24, scene);
        ground.scaling = new BABYLON.Vector3(1,.02,1);
    }
}
```
This is a stripped down version of the environment class. Right now we're just focusing on creating a simple ground mesh. This starting structure is important as it makes importing our final assets much easier.

We'll want to create our environment in [_setUpGame](/how_to/page9#setupgame), so now it should look something like:
```javascript
//--CREATE SCENE--
let scene = new Scene(this._engine);
this._gamescene = scene;

//--CREATE ENVIRONMENT--
const environment = new Envrionment(scene);
this._environment = environment;
await this._environment.load(); //environment
```
Before we go to the game state, we're creating our environment and loading the assets needed
# Character Controller
characterController.ts is going to contain all of the logic relating to our player and the player's movements.
```javascript
export class Player extends TransformNode {
    public camera;
    public scene: Scene;
    constructor(assets, scene: Scene, shadowGenerator: ShadowGenerator, input?: PlayerInput) {
        super("player", scene);
        this.scene = scene;
        this._setupPlayerCamera();

        this.mesh = assets.mesh;
        this.mesh.parent = this;

        shadowGenerator.addShadowCaster(assets.mesh); //the player mesh will cast shadows
    }
}
```
Now, we 're going to replace the camera we had in [state machine]() with the _setupPlayerCamera function
```javascript
var camera4 = new BABYLON.ArcRotateCamera("arc", -Math.PI/2, Math.PI/2, 40, new BABYLON.Vector3(0,3,0),scene);
```
This is also just a simple stationary camera for now, but the setup is necessary for when we work on the camera system.

Notice how in our constructor, we are passing in assets. These assets should be imported AFTER the environment is loaded (in case you have any dependencies between your player and meshes in the environment).
```javascript
//..loaded environment
await this._loadCharacterAssets(scene); //character
```
We just call *_loadCharacterAssets* at the end of *_setUpGame*.
## Loading Assets
In app.ts, we create [_loadCharacterAssets](). Inside of this function, we have the loadCharacter function, this is where we're setting up the character mesh system.
```javascript
//collision mesh
const outer = MeshBuilder.CreateBox("outer", { width: 2, depth: 1, height: 3 }, scene);
outer.isVisible = false;
outer.isPickable = false;
outer.checkCollisions = true;
```
Here we're creating the collider for the collision mesh of the character.
```javascript
//for collisions
outer.ellipsoid = new Vector3(1, 1.5, 1);
outer.ellipsoidOffset = new Vector3(0, 1.5, 0);
```
Then we set up the capsule collider that will be used for collisions.
```javascript
var box = MeshBuilder.CreateBox("Small1", { width: 0.5, depth: 0.5, height: 0.25, faceColors: [0,0,0,0,0,0] }, scene);
box.position.y = 1.5;
box.position.z = 1;

var body = Mesh.CreateCylinder("body", 3, 2,2,0,0,scene);
var bodymtl = new StandardMaterial("red",scene);
bodymtl.diffuseColor = new Color3(.8,.5,.5);
body.material = bodymtl;
body.isPickable = false;

//parent the meshes
box.parent = body;
body.parent = outer;
```
How I started off my character mesh was by creating a red cylinder for the body and a small black box to signify the front of the mesh.
```javascript
return {
    mesh: outer as Mesh
}
```
Then at the end, we return our character mesh.

At the end of _loadCharacterAssets,
```javascript
return loadCharacter().then(assets => {
    this.assets = assets;
});
```
Once we've returned our character mesh, we want to set our assets so we can pass it to our player constructor later.

You'll want this kind of structuring if you plan on importing a character mesh later on because it will ensure that all of the assets are loaded before moving on. 

# Initialize Game Async
The final steps of our player set up is to actually call the constructor. [_initializeGameAsync]() will do all of the finishing touches to prepare the game scene once everything is imported & meshes are created. At this point this function should only need to look like this:
```javascript
const light = new PointLight("sparklight", new Vector3(0, 0, 0), scene);
light.diffuse = new Color3(0.08627450980392157, 0.10980392156862745, 0.15294117647058825);
light.intensity = 35;
light.radius = 1;

const shadowGenerator = new ShadowGenerator(1024, light);
shadowGenerator.darkness = 0.4;

//Create the player
this._player = new Player(this.assets, scene, shadowGenerator); //dont have inputs yet so we dont need to pass it in
```
Every scene needs at least one light, and that light for my game was the player's light. The shadow generator uses a single light source, but you can have multiple shadow generators. And then, we finally create our player.

Now you when you go to the game state, you'll have a player mesh and a ground!
