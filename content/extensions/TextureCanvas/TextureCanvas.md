# About
TextureCanvas is a texture on which other textures can be drawn.

# Usage
## Creating a canvas
To construct a TextureCanvas, you need to provide the size and the scene the texture will be used in:
```javascript
// A square texture
let canvas = new TextureCanvas(128, scene);
```
```javascript
// A rectangular texture
let canvas = new TextureCanvas({ width: 256, height: 128 }, scene);
```
Aditionally, you may pass three more parameters, which are:
* *initTexture*, an initial texture to draw.
* *onReady*, a function to be called when the canvas is ready.
* *options*, an object with the properties *generateMipMaps* (boolean) and *samplingMode* (number)

## Draw using contexts
Contexts can be used to specify how a texture should be drawn. Multiple contexts can be created and used interchangably.<br>
To draw a texture using the default context, you can call ```canvas.drawTexture(myTexture)```.

You can create a context like this:
```javascript
let ctx = canvas.createContext();
```
A context has the following propteries:

Name | Type | Description
----|----|----|
diffuseTexture | [Texture](https://doc.babylonjs.com/api/classes/babylon.texture) | The texture to draw.
diffuseSamplingRect | [Rectangle](https://github.com/Poolminer/BabylonTextureCanvas/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#rectangle-class) | The area of the diffuse texture to draw.
drawRect | [Rectangle](https://github.com/Poolminer/BabylonTextureCanvas/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#rectangle-class) | The area to draw to.
rotation | [Vector3Matrix](https://github.com/Poolminer/BabylonTextureCanvas/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#vector3matrix-class) | The rotation axes in radians to rotate the diffuse textures by (*z* is 2D rotation).
pivotPoint | [PivotPoint](https://github.com/Poolminer/BabylonTextureCanvas/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#pivotpoint-class) | The rotation pivot point.
skewing | [UVector](https://github.com/Poolminer/BabylonTextureCanvas/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#uvector-class) | The amount of skewing/shearing.
opacityTexture | [Texture](https://doc.babylonjs.com/api/classes/babylon.texture) | The texture to get the alpha values from.
opacityTextureIntensity | number | How much the opacity texture should be contributing to the difuse's alpha values, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0
opacitySamplingRect | [Rectangle](https://github.com/Poolminer/BabylonTextureCanvas/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#rectangle-class) | The area of the opacity texture to use.
clearColor | [Color4](https://doc.babylonjs.com/api/classes/babylon.color4) | The color to clear the canvas with.

And the following methods:

Name | Parameters | Description
----|----|----|
reset |  | Resets the draw options to their default values.
setDiffuseSamplingRect | u, v, width, height | Sets which area of the diffuse texture to draw.
setOpacitySamplingRect | u, v, width, height | Sets which area of the opacity texture to draw.
setDrawRect | u, v, width, height | Sets which area of the canvas to draw to â€” this area may be tranformed by rotating/skewing.
setRotation | x?: number, y?: number, z?: number | Sets the rotation axes in radians rotate the diffuse texture by (*z* is 2D rotation).
setPivotPoint | pu?: number, pv?: number, isLocalSpace?: boolean | Sets the point around which to rotate the texture.
setSkewing | u, v | Sets how the texture should be skewed (shear transform).
draw |  | Draws the diffuse texture, if set.
drawTexture | diffuseTexture: Texture | Draws a texture.
clear |  | Clears the canvas using the set clearColor.
clone | cloneDrawOptions?:&nbsp;boolean, cloneTextures?:&nbsp;boolean, ref?:&nbsp;TextureCanvasDrawContext | Returns a clone of the context.

Once the context is set up, simply call ```ctx.draw()``` or ```ctx.drawTexture(myTexture)```

# Notes

Please note that uv-coordinates are used rather than pixel values.

## Rotation

Rotating a texture happens in three dimensions in the default coordinate system of Babylon.js, with *z* being the forward axis.<br>
You can set a pivot point to be in local space (that of the diffuse texture), or world space (that of the canvas), with ```pivotPoint.isLocalSpace```.
